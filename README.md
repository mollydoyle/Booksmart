# Booksmart
This is my first attempt at building a website to help students trade their textbooks to each other on campus. Website is complete and can be viewed at www.booksmartnd.com. I am currently working on building a login system with user accounts which will be the first major overhaul to the site. 

# UPDATE: 10/26

User management system has been created. Users now have dedicated accounts, and the site has been adjusted accordingly. It is still in its early stages and not ready to be pushed to master, but the curious can clone the login_system branch to see what it currently looks like.
